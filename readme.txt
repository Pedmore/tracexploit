Project Name: TraceXploit 
Date Last Modified: 21 Apr 2010

Overview: 

TraceXploit consists of 2 stages: training and replay stage.
Stage 1 is the implementation of Discoverer, which will produce many "templates" of many types of packets/protocol after feeding it numerous samples (~3million packets).
Then, during stage 2 (replay), the (sent + received) packets will be matched against the "templates" for any fields such as cookies or variable length. These will be stored and changed according during replay.
The sample (*.phase1) files are the output of phase 1 of discoverer. Basically they represent the token patterns of the packets.

This project consists of 2 folder
1) source 
	==> contains source code
2) output
	a) pcap
		==> contains pcap of the replay attack
	b) phase 1
		==> contains outputs of phase 1 

Todo: 

1) Resolve a bug in the code when parsing a .pcap consisting of numerous kinds of protocols.
	==> Might have failed to consider certain types of packets/protocols during parsing. But I didn't spend more time fixing this as the straighforward replay and phase 1 of training mode already works.
2) Tidying of code
	==> I have put notes during my coding to remind myself of the things to do in future if I'm selected for this project. These are commented with //TODO... 
	==> Definitely will be cleaned up in final version.
